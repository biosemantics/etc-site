This name will be used in Task Manager and output folders (Input Folder Name + Task Name = Output Folder Name). <br><br><b>Selected Description Folder:</b> Shown the description folder you selected for this task in the Input step. <b>Click <span style='color:green'><b>Select Folder</b></span></b> button to select a different folder if needed. <br><br><b>Selected Term Review Folder:</b> Shown the 'Terms Reviewed' folder system auto-selected for this task, if any. You should not change this unless you know what you are doing. <br><br><b>Selected Ontology Folder:</b> Shown the ontology folder system auto-selected for this task, if any. You should not change this unless you know what you are doing. <br><br><b>Select Taxon Group:</b>Select a taxon group relevant to your input. System will use the resources (e.g., glossary) relevant/related to your taxon group in this task. <br><br><b>Inherit Values:</b> Check this option if you want character states from a higher rank (e.g. family) to be propagated into lower ranks (e.g. genus, species). Propagation is done only when the lower rank taxa have no values for the character states. <br><br><b>Infer Absent/Present States:</b> Check this option if you want the system to infer presence/absence of organs/parts based on stated information. This will result in many more characters and take more time to complete the task."}
