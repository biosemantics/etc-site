The terms categorized on ETC site can be directly imported into OTO with you as the owner of the term set. You and others can co-categorize the terms on OTO and help grow the consensus-based glossary/ontology for your group and improve the performance of biodiversity software applications including ETC tools. <h3>What does "Link" mean?</h3> <p>Link means to link your ETC account to your OTO account and if you don't have an account on OTO, one will be created for you by <span style='color:green'><b>checking Share Terms with Community</b></span> and following the instruction on My Account page. <p> Once the link is established, you can send your terms to OTO from within the ETC site."},
