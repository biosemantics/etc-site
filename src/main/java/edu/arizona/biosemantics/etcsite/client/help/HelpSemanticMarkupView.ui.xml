		The software has discovered a set of terms from the input descriptions and it needs you to check on some of the terms. The terms are shown either in the left Terms to be Categorized area or in the category boxes in the right Categories and Categorization Results area. These categorizations are based on the existing glossaries and other users categorization for the same taxon group, and the software's decisions, but you can discard previous categorizations. 
		<br/>Now you need to review the categorizations in the right area, and if there are to-be-categorized terms in the left area, you need to either categorize these terms or mark them as "not useful". 
		<br/>You are also encouraged to synonymize terms. If you believe one term belongs to multiple categories, you can categorize it into different categories. You can correct typos in the terms and leave comments on a term/your categorization.	You can add new categories if needed. You can download your categorization results to your local computer. More information related to a term is provided for you in the Term Information area to assist your review/categorization. 
		<br/>Most operations on this page can be done by drag and drop or through the popup menus invoked by right-clicks on a term, a category, or even some white spaces. 
		<br/>After completing the review, click on Next Step in Text Capture button to move to the parse step.

        <g:HTML>
            To categorize a term into a category, drag the term and drop it on the category name of the appropriate category box. Alternatively, right-click on a term to invoke its popup menu, then select Categorize > Categorize to and select appropriate categories. 
<br/>
To un-categorize a term (i.e., remove the categorization for the term), drag the term and drop it in the Terms to be Categorized area. Alternatively, right-click on a term to invoke its popup menu, then select Categorize > Remove. 
Discard categorization results<br/>
Before you are landed on the Review step, the software has pre-populated some categorizations based on the existing glossaries and other users categorization for the same taxon group, in addition to the software's decisions. 
<br/>
If you would like to personally categorize each of the terms, i.e., to discard the pre-populated categorization results, go to main menu, File > Remove Categorizations > All. The software will move all categorized terms to the Terms to be Categorized area for you to categorize. 
<br/>
If after categorizing the terms for a while, you would like to return to the initial state of the Review step (meaning, to the state where the software just pre-populated the categorization and before any categorization is done by you or your collaborators), go to main menu, File > Remove Categorization > Users categorizations<br/>
Mark a term "Not Useful"<br/>
To mark a to-be-categorized term "Not Useful" as a character, right-click on the term to invoke its popup menu, then select Term > Mark > Not Useful. 
<br/>
To mark a categorized term "Not Useful", first un-categorize the term, then do the above.<br/> 
<br/>Make synonyms
If two terms are synonyms or alternative spellings, you can make them synonyms by dragging term 1 onto term 2. Term 2 will be considered a preferred term (marked with a folder icon), holding all its synonyms, e.g., term 1. 
<br/>
To break up synonym relations, right-click on the preferred term (marked with a folder icon) to invoke its popup menu, select Synonymize > Remove Synonyms and select the synonyms to be released, or select Synonymize > Remove All Synonyms to release all synonyms. The released synonyms will remain in the same category.

        <g:HTML>
            A term can be categorized into multiple categories if needed. A to-be-categorized term can be put into multiple categories by right-clicking on the term to invoke its popup menu, then select Categorize > Categorize to and select appropriate categories. 
<br/>
A categorized term can be copied into multiple categories as well, by either drag and drop the term to additional desired categories and select "Copy" when prompted, or by right-clicking on the term to invoke its popup menu, then select Categorize > Copy to and select appropriate categories. 
Correct typos and add comments<br/>
To correct typos, right-click on a term to invoke its popup menu, select Term > Correct Spelling. 
<br/>
To comment on a term, right-click on a term to invoke its popup menu, select Term > Comment. You can view all the comments made on the current set of terms by clicking on the Comments menu on the main menu at the top of the term review interface. 
Create a new category
To add a new category, right-click on white space anywhere in the Categories and Categorization Results area to invoke its popup menu, and select Category > Add. You will need to provide a definition for the category you created. 
<br/>
Caution: All categories containing terms in the Categories and Categorization Results area, including user added ones, will be used later to generate characters for taxon-character matrices. Please do not create temporary convenient categories such as "not useful", "difficult terms", "misspellings" etc. Good categories are some characters your organisms have with a set of known states.

        <g:HTML>
            Term Information area, located at the lower part of the screen, provides you additional information about the terms, such as the categories a term currently is in (Locations tab), the source sentences where the term appears in the input descriptions (Context tab), and the definitions of the term in other ontologies (Ontologies tab). Click on a term, then select a tab to view corresponding information. 
<br/>
You can include ontologies of your choice by accessing the Ontologies menu on the main menu bar - including too many ontologies will slow down system responding time. The ontologies selected are not used in subsequence processing steps at this time. 
<br/>
To search for a term, use the Search menu on the main menu bar.
